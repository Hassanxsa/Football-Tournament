## How to Run the Project:

1. Clone the repo.
2. First, I've included a `.env.example` file with all the necessary API keys and DB connection variables. I know that's not the proper way, but it was done for the Grader's convenience.
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
4. Open two terminals.
5. In the first terminal, go to the project root directory, then to the server directory. Run the command: `npm install`.
6. In the same terminal, run: `npm run dev`.
7. Now, in the second terminal, go to the root directory of the project, then to the client2 directory, then to the vite-project directory.
8. Run `npm install`, then run `npm run dev`.
9. You're done! Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
